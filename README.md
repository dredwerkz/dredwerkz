## Hallo, I'm Jon.
### Or, if like me, you wish you lived in 1995's smash hit 'Hackers' - you can call me ***dredwerkz***

The handle's shamelessly 'adopted' from my favourite map in _id Software's_ **Quake 3 Arena**, which is a convenient segue into...

The last decade I've spent full-time in the esports industry, with roots in organising and running some of the largest LAN Party tournaments in the world.

Untangling spaghetti networks, streamlining gameservers, re-writing configs, building UDP consumers mid-way through an event, all just a day in the life.

Solving and refining complex solutions in production was always the name of the game, and is exactly why I've settled into software development so comfortably.

## Some projects I've been working on recently:

  - 📚 bookmarkd & its backend <sup>- _a School of Code final project_</sup>
    - React
    - Express
    - Node
    - Tailwind CSS

  - 🖥 As-Of-Yet-Unnamed Counter-Strike 2 server manager & admin panel <sup>- _The tool I wish I had while working in esports_</sup>
    - React

    - Node
    - WebSocket
  - 🏆 As-Of-Yet-Unnamed Discord-integrated tournament platform <sup>- _I've used everyone else's platform, now I'm making my own_</sup>
