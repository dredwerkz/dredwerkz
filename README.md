## Hallo, I'm Jon.
### Or, if like me, you wish you lived in 1995's smash hit 'Hackers' - you can call me ***dredwerkz***

The handle's shamelessly 'adopted' from my favourite map in _id Software's_ **Quake 3 Arena**, which is a convenient segue into...

The last decade I've spent full-time in the esports industry, with roots in organising and running some of the largest LAN Party tournaments in the world.

Untangling spaghetti networks, streamlining gameservers, re-writing configs, building UDP consumers mid-way through an event, all just a day in the life.

Solving and refining complex solutions in production was always the name of the game, and is exactly why I've loved diving into software development.

## Some projects I've been working on recently:
