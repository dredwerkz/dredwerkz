## Hey, I'm Jon.

The handle ***dredwerkz*** was shamelessly 'adopted' from my favourite map in _id Software's_ **Quake 3 Arena**, which serves here as a convenient segue into...

...the last decade I spent full-time in the esports industry, where I organised and ran some of the largest LAN tournaments in the world.

Untangling spaghetti networks, streamlining game-servers, re-writing configs, building UDP consumers mid-way through an event, somehow just all a day in the life.

Solving and refining complex solutions in production has always been the name of the game, and is exactly why I've loved diving into software development.
