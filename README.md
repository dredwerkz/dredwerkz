## Hey, I'm Jon.

A full-stack software engineer with a decade's experience working in the esports industry!

Games Dev, working right now in C# stacks while trying to keep .NET3 and Node 12 apps breathing on the side.
Got a specific interest in building tech that interfaces with games for analystics and management, especially with an esports twist.

Personal projects a bit dead for now, and hopefully I'll be able to talk about what I'm working on some day soon ðŸ¤“
